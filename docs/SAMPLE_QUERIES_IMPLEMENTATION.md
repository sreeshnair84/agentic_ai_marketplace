#### Tool Models (tools/app/models/tools.py)
- ✅ Added `EnhancedToolRegistryBase` with signatures
- ✅ Added MCP configuration support
- ✅ Added runtime requirements and constraints
- ✅ Added configuration schema validation

#### Workflow Models (workflow-engine/app/models/workflows.py)

## Usage Examples

### Quick Start for New Users
```bash
# Get overview of all available sample queries
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/

# Get quick start queries for beginners
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/quick-start

# Get queries for specific service
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/agents
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/tools
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/workflows
```

### Role-Based Queries
```bash
# Get contextual queries for developers
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/agents/contextual/developer
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/workflows/contextual/devops

# Get queries for business analysts
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/workflows/contextual/business_analyst
```

### Advanced Filtering
```bash
# Search across all services
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/search?q=data processing&service=workflows

# Filter by tags
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/tools/by-tags?tags=mcp&tags=file

# Filter by complexity
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/workflows/by-complexity?complexity=beginner
```

### Category-Specific Queries
```bash
# Agent categories
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/agents/agent_discovery
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/agents/agent_execution

# Tool categories  
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/tools/mcp_tools
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/tools/custom_tools

# Workflow categories
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/workflows/workflow_creation
GET /api/v1/sample-queries/workflows/workflow_automation
```

## Frontend Integration

### Chat Interface Integration
The sample queries can be integrated into the chat interface to provide:

1. **Guided Onboarding**: Show quick start queries to new users
2. **Contextual Suggestions**: Display relevant queries based on current conversation
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start with beginner queries and progress to advanced
4. **Role-Based Recommendations**: Tailor suggestions based on user role

### UI Components
```javascript
// Example React component for sample queries
const SampleQueries = ({ userRole, currentContext }) => {
  const [queries, setQueries] = useState([]);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch contextual queries based on user role
    fetch(`/api/v1/sample-queries/agents/contextual/${userRole}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setQueries(data.contextual_queries));
  }, [userRole]);
  
  return (
    <div className="sample-queries">
      <h3>Suggested Queries</h3>
      {queries.map(query => (
        <QueryCard 
          key={query.query}
          query={query.query}
          description={query.description}
          onClick={() => onQuerySelect(query.query)}
        />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users get guided examples instead of blank interface
2. **Faster Onboarding**: New users can quickly understand system capabilities
3. **Discovery**: Users discover features they might not know about
4. **Best Practices**: Queries demonstrate proper usage patterns
5. **Role-Based**: Tailored suggestions based on user role and expertise level
6. **Searchable**: Users can find relevant examples quickly
7. **Scalable**: Easy to add new queries and categories

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**: Connect sample queries to chat interface
2. **Analytics**: Track which queries are most popular
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Allow queries to be updated without code changes
4. **Personalization**: Learn user preferences and customize suggestions
5. **Interactive Examples**: Add executable examples with real data
6. **Documentation**: Auto-generate documentation from sample queries
